# tictactoe3d
This project develops a system for managing classic Tic-Tac-Toe and 3D Tic Tac Toe. It provides an interactive gaming experience, allowing authenticated users via JWT to play against each other or the computer. The system supports multiple active games simultaneously, ensuring each user participates in only one game at a time.
